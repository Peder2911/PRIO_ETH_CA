# Sentences codebook

This document describes coding criteria for coding sentences describing
ceasefires.  The purpose of this coding effort is to create training data for a
machine-learning system that will assist coders in the task of coding
ceasefires. This sentence coding is thus meant to facilitate the coding effort
itself, making it more effective over time.

It is important to formalize the coding criteria to ensure reliability. These
criteria are given in this document, and should be followed closely in order to
produce high-quality training data, and thus better predictions from the model.

## Instructions

When you recieve a sheet containing sentences with a column for predictions,
start going through them.

The column "prediction" contains a 1 if a sentence was predicted to be
indicating the start of a ceasefire, and 0 if a sentence was not predicted to
be indicating the start of a ceasefire (see definitions below).

If the prediction made by the model is correct, for example if a sentence
predicted as 1 actually indicates the start of a ceasefire, the row-value in
the column "valid" should be 1.  If the prediction is wrong, for example if a
sentence predicted as 0 actually indicates the start of a ceasefire, the
row-value for the column "valid" should be 0. 

## Coding rules:

These are the rules that were followed when coding the data that was used to
produce predictions currently given by the model:

### Positive definition:

The prototypical sentence we are looking for is:

- $x$ and $y$ have signed a ceasefire.  
  
Where $x$ and $y$ refer to parties in a ceasefire. 

Sentences with one, or zero parties might also be interesting, such as:

- $x$ declared a ceasefire
- $x$ is now observing a ceasefire
- A ceasefire was declared
- A ceasefire went into effect 
- A ceasefire started at $z$ 

Where $z$ refers to a point in time, such as a date.

These sentences share the following characteristics:
- The sentences refer to a past event (the start of a ceasefire)
- The sentences are unambiguous (no maybe / might have / should have)

The sentences could also include the precise time of the event, or this could
be inferred from the publication date of the article at the time of coding.

### Negative definition:

The following sentences should be coded as negative:

- $x$ and $y$ will sign a ceasefire at $z$
- The parties are urged to sign a ceasefire 
- $x$ would / wants to sign a ceasefire 
- $x$ proposes a ceasefire 
- $x$ offers a ceasefire to $y$ 
- $x$ will enforce a ceasefire

These sentences do not refer to an event, but the intentions of actors. While
these sentences might be useful indications of the probability of a ceasefire
occuring, they are not actual indications of the phenomenon to be coded.

These sentences should also be coded as negative:

- During the ceasefire...something occurred
- $x$ and $y$Â are respecting the ceasefire
- After the ceasefire, the situation has improved 
- Despite the ceasefire, violence is frequent

These sentences refer to ceasefires in progress, and might not be useful for
coding the start of ceasefires.

## Developing the criteria

These criteria are not final, and should be developed as we move forward.
However, extensive changes would require extensive re-coding, as 3000 sentences
have been coded using these criteria already.
